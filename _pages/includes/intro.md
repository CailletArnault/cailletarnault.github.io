## Who is Arnault?

I am the **Chief Scientific Officer and late co-founder at [Yneuro](https://yneuro.com)**.
There, I lead and actively contribute to scientific R&D, pioneering **neuro-biometric authentication** through our proprietary and patented technology, **Neuro ID®**.

I am also currently a Visiting researcher at [Imperial College London](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/arnault.caillet17) and Université de Nantes, where I co-supervise PhD students and contribute to publications on motor control (NeurIPS) and muscle adaptation (4 journal papers), respectively.

I am also a part-time coach to A-level, university, and academic students in the UK and France.

I am a scientific researcher. During my [PhD](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/current-and-recent-student-profiles/phd-students/2019-phd-candidate---caillet-arnault/) in computational neuroscience and biometrical engineering (Imperial College London) and later as a Research Associate at Imperial College London (Prof. Farina's [Neuromechanics and Rehabilitation Technology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/neuromechanics-rehabilitation-technology/) Research Group), I contributed to three ERC European projects (Natural BionicS, NISNEM, and HybridNeuro) focused on computational methods for the natural integration of bionic limbs via spinal interfacing. During this time, I have published 9 journal and conference papers (6 first-author) in leading journals (e.g., IEEE RBME, eLife) and ML conferences (e.g., NeurIPS) in topics like EEG-EMG coherence, high-density EMG, motor control, motor unit physiology, and neuro-musculo-skeletal computational models.

I am also a General Engineer (MSc, École Centrale de Lyon) with a specialization in Structural Engineering (MSc, Imperial College London).

### My philosophy

Whether my work is public (and thus open-source) or private, it is most important to me to deliver quality work with honesty and openess and concrete proof of my research advances with a product-oriented vision. For example, in this optic, our flagship product Neuro ID has been [freely tested](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/st%C3%A9phanie-obertin-7952677a_yneuro-nexus2025-yneuro-ugcPost-7341804939616108544-RK2X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACEhyXYB-hpZDZ3p59wL-KyTViY6EwvFMaw) for the past two years over multiple tech venues, private meetings, and mainstream media.
I am also an active contributor of open-source research (including datasets and code, reported [here](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Z72zPxwAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao)).

### My role at Yneuro

My work as CSO involves turning scientific research advances into a concrete product for everyday life, assert the quality and validation of our products, building and managing our amazing scientific team, interfacing with clients and responding to their specs, interfacing leading the IP strategy and filing patents to protect our IP, and building strategic partnerships with scientific actors.

My work as EEG team lead is at the intersection of neuroscience and AI to redefine secure, personalized identity solutions. My technical expertise includes Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineering, large-scale diverse EEG databases, EEG data curation and preprocessing semi-automatic methods, domain adaptation methods, deep learning for EEG decoding including foundation models, benchmarking, and authentication solutions. I am using this multidisciplinary expertise to manage an amazing and constantly growing team of PhD-level AI research scientists, ML Engineers, Data Engineers, Data scientists, EEG experts, domain adaptation experts, and data owners.

I am also a key contributor of our development, especially on the aspects of developing AI models and routines and on benchmarking pipelines:

### My other current activities

Besides my activity as CSO, I am a Visiting Researcher at Imperial College London, contributing to open-source efforts enabling large-scale availability of high-density EMG data and advanced benchmarks of decomposition into individual motor unit activity (NeurIPS) and co-supervising a PhD student on electrophysiological and mechanical characterization of subject- and muscle-specific motoneuron and motor unit properties in vivo.
I am also a Visiting Researcher at Université de Nantes, co-supervising a PhD student to develop computational neuromusculoskeletal methods for the quantified simulation and prediction of synergistic muscle adaptation patterns and the prevention of muscle injuries, which yielded 4 top-level journal papers.
