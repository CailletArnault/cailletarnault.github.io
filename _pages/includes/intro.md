# Who is Arnault?

I am the **Chief Scientific Officer and Founding Scientist** of **<img src="images/yneuro_logo.png" alt="Yneuro" style="height:22px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:2px; margin-right:4px;">[Yneuro](https://www.yneuro.com/)**, where I lead and actively contribute (with my _amazing_ team) to scientific R&D, driving our proprietary and patented **neuro-biometric authentication** technology, **Neuro ID®**.
<br><br>
I’m also a **Visiting Researcher** at <img src="images/imperial_logo.png" alt="Imperial College London" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:2px; margin-right:4px;">**[Imperial College London](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/arnault.caillet17)** and <img src="images/nantes_logo.png" alt="Université de Nantes" style="height:19px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:-1px; margin-right:3px">**Université de Nantes**, where I co-supervise PhD students and collaborate on projects in **motor control** and **muscle adaptation**.
<br><br>
I'm a **scientific researcher** with six years of academic research experience in London 🇬🇧, specializing in the **decoding of neurophysiological signals** and the application of **machine learning** and **deep learning** to brain and muscle activity analysis.

During my **[PhD](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/entities/publication/297847f5-ad14-4461-bacd-91172f0d55f0)** in **computational neuroscience** and **biomechanical engineering** at Imperial College London, and later as a **Research Associate** in Prof. Farina’s [Neuromechanics and Rehabilitation Technology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/neuromechanics-rehabilitation-technology/) research group, I contributed to **three ERC projects** 🇪🇺 (**[Natural BionicS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/810346)**, **[NISNEM](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FT020970%2F1)**, **[HybridNeuro](https://www.hybridneuro.feri.um.si/)**) focused on the computational integration of bionic limbs through spinal interfacing.  
My [academic work](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Z72zPxwAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao) has resulted in **twelve opens-source publications** (six as first author) in top journals (e.g., _IEEE RBME_, _eLife x2_) and ML conferences (e.g., _NeurIPS x2_), covering topics such as EEG-EMG coherence, high-density EMG capture and analysis, EMG decoding, motor control, motor unit physiology, and computational neuro-musculoskeletal modeling.
<br><br>
I hold dual MSc degrees - **General Engineering** (<img src="images/centrale_lyon_logo.png" alt="École Centrale de Lyon" style="height:25px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:-1px; margin-right:2px;">_École Centrale de Lyon_) and **Structural Engineering** (<img src="images/imperial_logo.png" alt="Imperial College London" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:2px; margin-right:4px;">_Imperial College London_).

# My other current activities

Beyond Yneuro, I’m a **Visiting Researcher** at <img src="images/imperial_logo.png" alt="Imperial College London" style="height:18px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:2px; margin-right:2px;">**Imperial College London**, contributing to open-source efforts on large-scale high-density EMG datasets and advanced motor unit decomposition benchmarks (_NeurIPS_).  
I also co-supervise a PhD student on subject- and muscle-specific motoneuron and motor unit modeling in vivo.

Also a **Visiting Researcher** at <img src="images/nantes_logo.png" alt="Université de Nantes" style="height:19px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:-1px; margin-right:2px">**Université de Nantes**, I co-supervise another PhD project on computational neuromusculoskeletal modeling, focusing on muscle adaptation and injury prevention, which has resulted in four journal publications.
<br><br>

# My philosophy

Whether public or proprietary, my priority is to deliver **high-quality, transparent, and verifiable research** with a product-driven mindset.  
For example, our flagship **Neuro ID® demos** have been [publicly tested](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/st%C3%A9phanie-obertin-7952677a_yneuro-nexus2025-yneuro-ugcPost-7341804939616108544-RK2X?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACEhyXYB-hpZDZ3p59wL-KyTViY6EwvFMaw) by over a thousand curious participants across major tech events, private showcases, and media coverage.  
I also contribute to **open-source research**, including datasets and code — see my [Open-Source Contributions](#-open-source-contributions) section.
